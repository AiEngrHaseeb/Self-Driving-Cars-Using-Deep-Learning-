# Self-Driving-Cars-Using-Deep-Learning-
We all know self-driving cars is one of the hottest areas of research and business for the tech giants. What seemed like a science-fiction, a few years ago, now seems more like something which is soon to become a part and parcel of life. The reason, I am saying “soon to be” is because even though companies like Tesla, Nissan, Cadillac do have self-driving car assistance software, but they still require a human to keep an eye on the road and take control when needed. However, it is fascinating to see how far we have come in terms of innovation and how fast technology is advancing. So much so, that now, with the help of basic deep learning, neural network magic, we can build our own pipeline for autonomous driving! Excited? I sure am! Let’s get right into it then.
